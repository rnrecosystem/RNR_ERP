## Automatic Accounting Integration

When a payment is posted, the system automatically creates:

1. **Supplier Account** - Credit (reduces liability)
2. **Payment Account** - Debit (cash/bank account)
3. **TDS Account** - Credit (if TDS deducted)
4. **Deduction Accounts** - Credit (if other deductions)

## Error Handling

The API returns standard HTTP status codes:

- `201` - Created
- `400` - Bad Request (validation errors)
- `401` - Unauthorized
- `404` - Not Found
- `500` - Internal Server Error

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Bill Payment

1. Get outstanding bills: `GET /outstanding-bills/1`
2. Create payment: `POST /pay-against-bills`
3. Post payment: `POST /{payment_id}/post`
4. Reconcile: `POST /{payment_id}/reconcile`

### Scenario 2: Partial Bill Payment

1. Get outstanding bills
2. Select specific bills with partial amounts
3. Create payment with TDS deduction
4. Post and reconcile

### Scenario 3: Advance Payment

1. Create advance payment (no bills)
2. Later adjust against new bills
3. Track advance balance

## Database Tables Created

1. **supplier_payments** - Main payment entries
2. **supplier_payment_bills** - Links payments to bills
3. **supplier_ledger** - Running balance ledger
4. **tds_entries** - TDS tracking and certificates

## Required Account Codes

The migration creates these account codes:
- `CASH_IN_HAND` - Cash payments
- `BANK_ACCOUNT` - Bank transfers
- `UPI_ACCOUNT` - UPI payments  
- `CREDIT_CARD_ACCOUNT` - Credit card payments
- `TDS_PAYABLE` - TDS liability
- `OTHER_DEDUCTIONS` - Other deductions

## Security Considerations

- All endpoints require JWT authentication
- Payments can only be updated in Draft status
- Posted payments cannot be deleted
- Audit trail maintained for all changes
- Bank account validation for sensitive operations

## Performance Optimizations

- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Batch processing for bulk operations
- Optimized queries for reports
- Caching for reference data

## Testing

Use the API endpoints with Postman or curl:

```bash
# Get outstanding bills
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/supplier-payments/outstanding-bills/1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token"

# Create payment  
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/supplier-payments/pay-against-bills" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" \
  -d '{...payment_data...}'
```

## Next Steps

1. Test all API endpoints
2. Configure TDS rates per tax regulations
3. Set up bank account mappings
4. Create custom reports as needed
5. Configure automated reconciliation processes
